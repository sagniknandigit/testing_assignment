# Simple Form Validation App

## ðŸ”§ What I Built
A basic web form that collects a user's name and email. JavaScript is used to validate that both fields are filled and the email contains "@" before allowing submission. A simple Python script mimics backend data reception.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

## ðŸš€ How to Run It

### Frontend
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Fill in the form.
3. On clicking Submit:
   - Success or error alerts will show depending on input.

### Python Script
1. Run `form_receiver.py` using:
   ```bash
